# Hartree-Fock implementation for learning

I'm following [this](https://youtu.be/eDAfpQIMde0?list=PL-hN8vfRaU7jSFHN1ZSAMNe_2nXhwAmzM) series of videos on YouTube and trying to implement stuff more on my style, without too much copy from the video. I'm also using more modern Python conding (video is from 3 years ago now).

To run this, just make sure you're on Python 3.10 or newer, install `numpy` and run `python hartree_fock.py`.
